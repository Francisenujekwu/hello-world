For CO2 adsorption on graphene surfaces

Hi guys
My name is Francis Enujekwu
A new PhD student in the university of nottingham

my interest is to develop computational models that can describe the mechanism of CO2 adsorption on graphene surfaces
it will agree favouralbly with the experimental results
